# Battleships-Game
A basic Battleships inspired command line game written in Python.

Battle Ships was the first video game I had ever coded, and my first exposure to Python.
This was a group project, where I acted as the development lead - 
implementing and excercising Agile methodologies to see the completion of the project.
This project was completed over the course of 10 days 
and was the final submission for the Programming Principles (IT5014) course at Computer Power Plus. 
IT5014 is a 15 credit Level 5 subject, which is a component of the New Zealand Certificate in Infromation Technology (L5).

Player may only place their ships - the guessing phase of the game is yet to be implemented.
